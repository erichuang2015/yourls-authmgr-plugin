yourls-authmgr-plugin
=====================
Please see [AuthMGrPlus](https://github.com/joshp23/YOURLS-AuthMgrPlus) for active development. AuthMgrPlus is a substantial update and rewrite to this plugin which realizes _most-if-not-all_ requested/desired feature and clears all error-based issues.
--------------------

This plugin adds role-based access controls (RBAC) to YOURLS. By assigning users to roles like "Editor" and "Contributor" you can limit the changes they are permitted to make.

With access controls enabled, you can safely delegate access to the admin pages.

Installation
------------
1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/nicwaller/yourls-authmgr-plugin/tags) of yourls-authmgr-plugin.
1. Copy the plugin folder into your `user/plugins` folder for YOURLS.
1. Set up the parameters for authmgr (details below)
1. Activate the plugin with the plugin manager in the YOURLS admin interface.

Default Roles
-------------
The default roles are set up as follows:

Role          | Capabilities
--------------|-------------------------------------------------
Administrator | No Limits
Editor        | Cannot manage plugins
Contributor   | Cannot manage plugins, edit URLs, or delete URLs

Configuration
-------------
Add role assignments to your `user/config.php` file.

```
$authmgr_role_assignment = array(
  'administrator' => array(
    'your_username',
  ),
  'editor' => array(
    'your_close_friend',
  ),
  'contributor' => array(
    'your_other_friend',
  ),
);
```

You can also designate a range of IP addresses that will automatically be granted all capabilities. By default, all accesses from IPv4 localhost (127.0.0.0/8) are granted full access.

```
$authmgr_admin_ipranges = array(
    '127.0.0.0/8',
);
```
